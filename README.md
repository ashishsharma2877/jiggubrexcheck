# Bino & Jiggu Extramarital Thoughts Checker

A simple Node.js CLI script that interactively checks whether Binoâ€™s and Jigguâ€™s extramarital thoughts align. The loop continues until Binoâ€™s extramarital thoughts are fulfilled or either user opts to exit.

---

## Features

* Prompts Bino to confirm if his extramarital thoughts are fulfilled.
* If not, prompts Jiggu for her current thoughts and Bino for his desired thoughts.
* Uses fuzzy substring matching (case-insensitive, punctuation-stripped) to determine compatibility.
* Allows either user to exit the loop at any prompt by typing `exit` or `quit`.
* Gracefully handles Ctrl-C (SIGINT) and EOF (Ctrl-D).

---

## Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v12 or higher
* A terminal or command prompt

---

4. The script will exit once thoughts are compatible or on exit.
